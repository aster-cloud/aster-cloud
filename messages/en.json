      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "whatIsAster": {
        "question": "What is Aster Cloud?",
        "answer": "Aster Cloud is a policy management platform that lets you define, test, and execute business rules as code. It's ideal for compliance automation, decision engines, and business logic that changes frequently without code deployments."
      },
      "whatIsPolicy": {
        "question": "What is a policy and how do I create one?",
        "answer": "A policy is a set of business rules written in Aster's human-readable language. For example: 'if credit_score >= 700 and income > 50000 then approve_loan'. Create policies from the dashboard using our visual editor or by writing rules directly."
      },
      "piiDetection": {
        "question": "How does PII detection work?",
        "answer": "Our AI automatically scans your policies for personally identifiable information (PII) like email addresses, phone numbers, SSN, and financial data. Detected PII is flagged in reports to help you maintain compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulations."
      },
      "complianceStandards": {
        "question": "What compliance standards do you support?",
        "answer": "We generate compliance reports for GDPR (data protection), HIPAA (healthcare), SOC 2 (security controls), and PCI-DSS (payment data). Reports analyze your policies and provide actionable recommendations."
      },
      "integration": {
        "question": "Can I integrate Aster Cloud with my applications?",
        "answer": "Yes! Use our REST API to execute policies from any application. We provide code examples for JavaScript, Python, cURL, and more. API keys can be managed from Settings > API Keys."
      },
      "selfHosted": {
        "question": "Is there a self-hosted option?",
        "answer": "Enterprise customers can request on-premise deployment with dedicated support, custom SLA guarantees, and private cloud options. Contact our sales team for details."
      },
      "cancelAnytime": {
        "question": "Can I cancel my subscription anytime?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time. Your access will continue until the end of your current billing period."
      },
      "trialEnds": {
        "question": "What happens when my trial ends?",
        "answer": "After your trial ends, you'll be automatically downgraded to the Free plan. You can upgrade to Pro or Team at any time to regain access to premium features."
      },
      "refunds": {
        "question": "Do you offer refunds?",
        "answer": "We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with your subscription, contact us within 30 days for a full refund."
      },
      "apiVsExecutions": {
        "question": "What's the difference between API calls and executions?",
        "answer": "Executions count all policy runs (web UI + API). API calls only count requests made via the REST API. Each API request consumes both quotas. Web UI usage only consumes executions."
      },
      "upgradePlan": {
        "question": "How do I upgrade or downgrade my plan?",
        "answer": "You can upgrade anytime from this page. Your new plan takes effect immediately. To downgrade, cancel your current subscription and it will revert to Free at the end of the billing period."
      },
      "dataSecurity": {
        "question": "How is my data secured?",
        "answer": "All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256). We follow SOC 2 Type II practices and never share your policy data with third parties."
      },
      "invoices": {
        "question": "Can I get invoices for my subscription?",
        "answer": "Yes, invoices are automatically generated and sent to your email after each payment. You can also download past invoices from your Stripe customer portal."
      },
      "freeLimits": {
        "question": "What are the limitations of the Free plan?",
        "answer": "Free plan includes 3 saved policies, 100 executions/month, and basic PII detection. API access and compliance reports require a Pro or Team plan."
      },
      "support": {
        "question": "How can I contact support?",
        "answer": "Free users can reach us via email at support(at)aster-lang.cloud. Pro and Team users get priority support with faster response times."
