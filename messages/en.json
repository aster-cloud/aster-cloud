        "question": "What is Aster Cloud?",
        "answer": "Aster Cloud is a policy management platform that lets you define, test, and execute business rules as code. It's ideal for compliance automation, decision engines, and business logic that changes frequently without code deployments."
      },
      "whatIsPolicy": {
        "question": "What is a policy and how do I create one?",
        "answer": "A policy is a set of business rules written in Aster's human-readable language. For example: 'if credit_score >= 700 and income > 50000 then approve_loan'. Create policies from the dashboard using our visual editor or by writing rules directly."
      },
      "piiDetection": {
        "question": "How does PII detection work?",
        "answer": "Our AI automatically scans your policies for personally identifiable information (PII) like email addresses, phone numbers, SSN, and financial data. Detected PII is flagged in reports to help you maintain compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulations."
      },
      "complianceStandards": {
        "question": "What compliance standards do you support?",
        "answer": "We generate compliance reports for GDPR (data protection), HIPAA (healthcare), SOC 2 (security controls), and PCI-DSS (payment data). Reports analyze your policies and provide actionable recommendations."
      },
      "integration": {
        "question": "Can I integrate Aster Cloud with my applications?",
        "answer": "Yes! Use our REST API to execute policies from any application. We provide code examples for JavaScript, Python, cURL, and more. API keys can be managed from Settings > API Keys."
      },
      "selfHosted": {
        "question": "Is there a self-hosted option?",
        "answer": "Enterprise customers can request on-premise deployment with dedicated support, custom SLA guarantees, and private cloud options. Contact our sales team for details."
      },
      "downgrade": {
        "question": "What happens to my policies when I downgrade?",
        "answer": "When you downgrade to a lower plan, policies beyond your new limit are automatically frozen (newest policies remain active). Frozen policies can still be viewed but cannot be executed or edited. To unfreeze, either delete some policies or upgrade your plan. Your policy data is never deleted during a downgrade."
      },
      "cancelAnytime": {
        "question": "Can I cancel my subscription anytime?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time. Your access will continue until the end of your current billing period."
      },
      "trialEnds": {
        "question": "What happens when my trial ends?",
        "answer": "After your trial ends, you'll be automatically downgraded to the Free plan. You can upgrade to Pro or Team at any time to regain access to premium features."
      },
      "refunds": {
        "question": "Do you offer refunds?",
        "answer": "We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with your subscription, contact us within 30 days for a full refund."
      },
      "apiVsExecutions": {
        "question": "What's the difference between API calls and executions?",
        "answer": "Executions count all policy runs (web UI + API). API calls only count requests made via the REST API. Each API request consumes both quotas. Web UI usage only consumes executions."
      },
      "upgradePlan": {
        "question": "How do I upgrade or downgrade my plan?",
