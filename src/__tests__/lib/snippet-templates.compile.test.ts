/**
 * Snippet template *engine* contract.
 *
 * The sibling `snippet-templates.test.ts` checks structural invariants
 * (id format, Module/Rule presence, page-action coverage). It does NOT
 * compile the CNL, which is how a batch of templates using `has` as an
 * infix operator — and two using `not equal to`, which lowers to a `!=`
 * call the interpreter can't resolve — once shipped: every one of them
 * satisfied the structural checks while being un-runnable in the editor.
 *
 * A template that doesn't compile (or compiles but throws at eval) is a
 * dead Open-in-Playground button: the user clicks "Try it", the editor
 * loads, and the first thing they see is an error on canonical example
 * code. That is the worst possible first impression for an adoption
 * funnel, so this test makes it a hard CI failure.
 *
 * It uses the *real* vendored engine (no `vi.mock`) — the same
 * `@aster-cloud/aster-lang-ts/browser` build production loads — so a
 * template only passes here if it would actually run for a user.
